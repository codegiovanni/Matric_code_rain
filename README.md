# Matrix_code_rain
Matrix code rain using Python with Pygame

Create a project folder and put in it code itself and a font folder with ms mincho.ttf font itself. Then run the code and font will be found with "font = pygame.font.Font('font/ms mincho.ttf', FONT_SIZE)" command line (you don't need to add anything new).
